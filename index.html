Absolutely! I can create a responsive and visually appealing website interface for your Botpress-powered AI chatbot. Just provide me with the link to your Botpress chatbot, and I'll design a complete single-page HTML file that integrates with your chatbot's API.

The website will include:

A modern, clean UI design
Responsive layout that works on all devices
Chat interface with message history
Typing indicators
Proper integration with your Botpress endpoint
Optional features like:
Dark/light mode toggle
Chat history persistence
File upload capability
Emoji/rich media support
Please provide:

The URL endpoint for your Botpress chatbot
Any specific branding requirements (colors, logo, etc.)
Any special features you'd like included
Any preferences on layout/style
Here's how we'll proceed:

You'll provide the Botpress URL and any preferences
I'll create the complete HTML/CSS/JS implementation
You can test it and request any adjustments
We'll finalize the implementation
Would you like me to proceed with creating this website interface for your Botpress chatbot? Please share the link and any specific requirements you have.

I'll need the Botpress URL to properly integrate the chat functionality. Without this, I can't connect to the actual bot backend. Once received, I'll:

Structure the HTML to match common chat interfaces
Implement proper CSS for responsive design
Add JavaScript to handle sending/receiving messages
Include error handling for connection issues
Make sure the UI is intuitive and accessible
